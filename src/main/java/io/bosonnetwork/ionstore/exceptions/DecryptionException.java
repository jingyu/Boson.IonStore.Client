/**
 * Thrown when a retrieval cannot deliver the plaintext the caller asked for: the request and the
 * stored object disagree about encryption, the object cannot be framed for decryption, or the
 * ciphertext does not decrypt with the key.
 * <p>
 * This is a client-side condition, so it always carries {@link #NO_HTTP_STATUS} and
 * {@link #NO_ERROR_CODE} - the service never reports it. It covers:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an encrypted object retrieved without a decryption key (and without asking for the stored
 *       bytes as-is);</li>
 *   <li>a decryption key supplied for an object that is not encrypted;</li>
 *   <li>an encryption descriptor naming a scheme this client does not implement, or carrying a chunk
 *       size that is missing, malformed, or too small to hold an authentication tag;</li>
 *   <li>ciphertext that fails authentication - a wrong key, or tampered or truncated data. This is
 *       found while the payload streams, so a destination that cannot be rolled back may already
 *       have received part of it.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It is deliberately distinct from {@code ObjectIntegrityException}: that one means the bytes are not
 * what the service committed to, whereas this one means the bytes were never going to be readable in
 * the form that was requested.
