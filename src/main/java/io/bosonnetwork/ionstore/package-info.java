/**
 * A client for the Boson Ion Store service &mdash; a content-addressed, deduplicated binary object
 * store with per-object metadata, TTL, per-user quota and cross-node federation.
 * <p>
 * The {@link io.bosonnetwork.ionstore.IonStore} client, constructed through its
 * {@linkplain io.bosonnetwork.ionstore.IonStore#builder() builder}, uploads, downloads, lists and
 * deletes objects over the service's HTTP API. Unlike a REST client built on Vert.x
 * {@code WebClient}, it uses the lower-level streaming {@link io.vertx.core.http.HttpClient} so that
 * arbitrary-size object payloads are transferred incrementally without being buffered whole in
 * memory.
 *
 * <h2>Integrity</h2>
 * Every payload download is verified: the client hashes the streamed bytes (SHA-256) and compares the
 * result against the content id the service advertises in the {@code Ion-Content-Id} header, failing
 * with {@link io.bosonnetwork.ionstore.ObjectIntegrityException} on any mismatch.
 *
 * <h2>Authentication</h2>
 * Object retrieval is permissionless; upload, list and delete are authenticated with short-lived
 * {@link io.bosonnetwork.cwt.SignedCwt CWT} bearer tokens, minted in one of two mutually exclusive
 * modes: <b>user-key mode</b> (sign as the user) or <b>device mode</b> (sign as a device acting on
 * behalf of a user). Over HTTPS the service's self-signed certificate is pinned to its peer id.
 *
 * <h2>Errors</h2>
 * Failures are reported as {@link io.bosonnetwork.ionstore.IonStoreException}, which carries the HTTP
 * status of a service error response, or {@link io.bosonnetwork.ionstore.IonStoreException#NO_HTTP_STATUS}
 * for transport- or client-side failures (including integrity errors).
