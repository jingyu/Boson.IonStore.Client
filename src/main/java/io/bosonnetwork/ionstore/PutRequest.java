/**
 * A fluent, single-use description of one {@link IonStore} put: where the payload comes from, how it
 * should be described to the service, and whether it is encrypted on the way out.
 * <p>
 * Obtain one from {@link IonStore#put()}, configure it, then call {@link #send()}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ionStore.put()
 *         .name("photo.jpg")
 *         .contentType("image/jpeg")
 *         .content(pathToImageFile)
 *         .send();
 * }</pre>
 * Exactly one {@code content(...)} call decides the payload source; a later call replaces an earlier
 * one. Every other setter is optional and order-independent. Not thread-safe.
 *
 * <h2>Payload ownership</h2>
 * A put is asynchronous, and the payload is generally <em>not</em> copied - it is read as the upload
 * streams, so that a large payload does not cost a second copy in memory. The caller must therefore
 * leave the object passed to {@code content(...)} alone until the future returned by {@link #send()}
 * completes: do not modify the array or buffer, do not read from or close the stream, and do not
 * replace the file. The per-source notes on each {@code content(...)} overload spell out who closes
 * what.
 *
 * <h2>Custom metadata</h2>
 * Metadata supplied via {@link #metadata(String, Object)} is transmitted as {@code Ion-*} request
 * headers; a key that does not already start with {@code Ion-} is prefixed automatically. Because
 * metadata travels in headers it must be ASCII and kept small (the combined {@code Ion-*} headers
 * should stay within ~8&nbsp;KB). The names {@code Ion-TTL}, {@code Ion-Encrypted},
 * {@code Ion-Expire-At}, {@code Ion-Content-Id} and {@code Ion-Encryption} are managed for you and
 * are ignored if supplied as custom metadata.
 *
 * <h2>Reuse</h2>
 * {@link #send()} snapshots the request, so mutating it afterwards cannot disturb an upload already
 * in flight. It does <em>not</em> make the request replayable: a stream source is consumed by the
 * first send, and an encrypted put is randomised, so re-sending produces a different object rather
 * than a retry of the first (see {@link IonStore}'s encryption notes).
 *
 * @see IonStore#put()
