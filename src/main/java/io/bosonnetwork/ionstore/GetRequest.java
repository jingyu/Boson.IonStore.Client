/**
 * A fluent retrieval request, created by {@link IonStore#get(Id)} or {@link IonStore#get(Id, Id)}.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link PutRequest}, a get has no terminal {@code send()}: naming the destination <em>is</em>
 * the terminal operation, because once the destination is known there is nothing left to configure.
 * Every {@code to*} method starts the transfer and returns a future carrying the destination's own
 * result type, so {@link #toBytes()} yields a {@link BytesIonObject} without a cast, and a request
 * with no destination cannot be expressed at all.
 * <p>
 * Anything that shapes the transfer - {@link #decrypt(byte[])}, {@link #raw()} - is therefore set
 * before the destination:
 * <pre>{@code
 * BytesIonObject obj = store.get(id).decrypt(key).toBytes().get().orElseThrow();
 * store.get(peerId, id).toFile(path);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Every destination is fed the integrity-verified payload: the bytes on the wire are hashed while
 * they stream and checked against the content id the service advertised. The check completes only
 * once the whole body has been transferred, so a destination that cannot be rolled back (an
 * {@link OutputStream}, a {@link WriteStream}) may already have received the corrupt bytes when the
 * returned future fails; {@link #toFile(Path)} deletes its file in that case.
 * <p>
 * A request is not bound to a single use: each {@code to*} call is an independent transfer. It is not
 * thread-safe, and {@link #decrypt(byte[])} must not be called concurrently with a transfer it is
 * meant to apply to.
