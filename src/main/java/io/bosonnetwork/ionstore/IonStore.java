/**
 * A streaming client for a Boson Ion Store service: a content-addressed, deduplicated binary object
 * store.
 * <p>
 * The client uploads, downloads, lists, and deletes objects over the service's HTTP API. It is built
 * on the lower-level Vert.x {@link HttpClient} rather than the {@code WebClient} so that
 * arbitrary-size payloads are streamed incrementally instead of being buffered whole in memory.
 *
 * <h2>Integrity</h2>
 * Payload downloads are integrity-checked: the streamed bytes are hashed (SHA-256) and compared
 * against the content id the service advertises in the {@code Ion-Content-Id} header. A mismatch (or
 * a missing/malformed header) fails the download with {@link ObjectIntegrityException}. Because the
 * content id covers the whole object, ranged downloads are intentionally not offered - a partial body
 * cannot be verified.
 *
 * <h2>Encryption</h2>
 * A put may be encrypted client-side by supplying a key to {@link PutRequest#encrypt(byte[])}. The
 * service only ever sees ciphertext: the payload is encrypted as it streams, and the key never leaves
 * the client. Objects encrypted this way carry an {@code Ion-Encrypted} flag and an
 * {@code Ion-Encryption} descriptor naming the scheme and chunk size, so a reader can frame the
 * stream correctly without knowing what the writer's defaults were.
 *
 * <p><b>Encryption defeats deduplication, by design.</b> The store is content-addressed: an object's
 * content id is the SHA-256 of the bytes the service received, and identical bytes collapse to one
 * stored object. Encryption is randomised - every stream begins with a fresh random header - so the
 * same plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext on every put, yielding a different content id each
 * time. Two consequences follow:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Uploading identical plaintext twice stores it twice; the service cannot tell the two apart,
 *       and neither copy is charged against the other's quota.</li>
 *   <li>A retried put is a <em>new</em> object, not a re-put of the previous one. Callers that retry
 *       must treat the returned id as authoritative and discard the earlier one.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This is the intended trade-off: dropping it would require deterministic encryption, which would
 * leak plaintext equality to the service. Callers that need dedup across identical plaintexts should
 * store those objects unencrypted.
 *
 * <p>Ciphertext is slightly larger than its plaintext - a one-off stream header plus a per-chunk
 * authentication tag. {@link EncryptedReadStream#getCipherTextSize(long, int)} gives the exact
 * expansion, and {@link DecryptedWriteStream#getPlainTextSize(long, int)} inverts it, so the size
 * reported by the service can be mapped back to the plaintext size a caller cares about.
 *
 * <h2>Authentication</h2>
 * Object retrieval is permissionless and sends no token. Upload, list, and delete carry a short-lived
 * {@link SignedCwt CWT} bearer token, signed by the device key ({@link Builder#deviceKey}) on behalf
 * of a user. The user is identified either by its key pair ({@link Builder#userKey}, which derives the
 * user id) or by its id directly ({@link Builder#userId}); a device key is required either way. Over
 * HTTPS the service's self-signed certificate is pinned to its peer id.
 *
 * <h2>Connection reuse</h2>
 * Connections are pooled and reused, but are held for reuse only briefly: a connection that has gone
 * idle can be closed by the peer, the network, or - on mobile - the host platform, and nothing detects
 * that until a request is written into it and the write fails. Expiring pooled connections well inside
 * that window keeps the common case a fresh connection rather than a dead one.
 * <p>
 * <b>No request is ever retried automatically.</b> A transport failure tells us only that no response
 * arrived - never whether the service received and acted on the request - so retrying is a judgement
 * the caller is better placed to make: it knows whether repeating the operation is acceptable, and its
 * retry is visible where a silent one would not be. This applies uniformly, to reads and writes alike.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle &amp; threading</h2>
 * The underlying {@link HttpClient} is created when the client is constructed, so a client is ready
 * to use as soon as it is built; call {@link #close()} when finished to release it. Requests issued
 * after {@link #close()} fail with {@link IllegalStateException}. The returned
 * {@link CompletableFuture}s complete on the caller's Vert.x context. A Vert.x caller can turn one
 * back into a {@link io.vertx.core.Future} with {@code Future.fromCompletionStage}.
 *
 * <p>Instances are obtained through {@link #builder()}.
