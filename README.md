The Java client library for the **Boson Ion Store** service — a content-addressed, deduplicated binary object store with per-object metadata, TTL, per-user quota, and cross-node federation.

The client (`IonStore`) talks to the service over its HTTP API and, unlike a `WebClient`-based client, is built on the lower-level Vert.x `HttpClient` so that arbitrary-size object payloads are **streamed incrementally** instead of being buffered whole in memory.

## What Is Ion Store?

Ion Store is a Boson layer-2 service that stores binary objects addressed by content. Every object carries **two distinct ids**:

| Id | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **reference id** (`IonObject.getId()`) | A random, per-reference id used to address the object — the value embedded in `ions://<peerId>/<id>` URIs. |
| **content id** (`IonObject.getContentId()`) | The **SHA-256 of the bytes**. Used for integrity verification and server-side deduplication; several references may share one content id. |

Each object also has an optional file name, content type, TTL (lifetime), an `encrypted` flag, and arbitrary custom `Ion-*` metadata. Storage is subject to a per-user quota, and objects can be fetched from a remote Ion Store node through the service (federation).

---

## Features

- **Fluent** builder-style API: **`put()`** to store, **`get(id)`** to retrieve — configure the request, then pick a source (`put`) or a destination (`get`).
- Payload sources/sinks: `byte[]`, Vert.x `Buffer`, `java.nio.file.Path`, `java.io.InputStream`/`OutputStream`, and Vert.x `ReadStream`/`WriteStream`.
- Optional **client-side encryption** (`put().encrypt(key)`) and transparent **decryption** (`get(id).decrypt(key)`), or take the stored bytes verbatim with `get(id).raw()`.
- **Integrity-checked** downloads (SHA-256 vs `Ion-Content-Id`).
- Object **metadata**, **existence check**, paginated **listing**, and **deletion**.
- **Federated** retrieval from a named peer node.
- Asynchronous, non-blocking, Vert.x `Future`-based API.

## Adding as a Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bosonnetwork</groupId>
    <artifactId>boson-ion-store-client</artifactId>
    <version>${boson.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Native transport

This library carries no platform-specific native libraries, so it runs on Java NIO wherever it is deployed. To use Netty's native transport (epoll on Linux, kqueue on macOS), add the native jars for the platform the application runs on, and create the Vert.x instance the client runs on with `new VertxOptions().setPreferNativeTransport(true)`. For Linux x86_64:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-transport-native-epoll</artifactId>
    <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-transport-native-unix-common</artifactId>
    <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

The native jars must match the Netty version on the class path. See [Native Transport](https://docs.bosonnetwork.io/build-apps/java-sdk/native-transport) for every platform, Maven profiles and Gradle.

---

## Usage

The client is ready to use as soon as it is built (the underlying `HttpClient` is created in the constructor) — there is no `start()`. Call `close()` when finished. All operations return a `CompletableFuture` that completes on the caller’s Vert.x context; a Vert.x caller can convert one back with `Future.fromCompletionStage`. Cancellation is not supported.

### Create a client

**User-key mode** — when the application holds the full user private key:

```java
Id servicePeerId = Id.of("GbRwG3WgKgApSDBr9FGo5Y3RssSWxfWhanXMBdPCo5F2");

IonStore store = IonStore.builder()
        .userKey("<Base58-or-0x-hex-Ed25519-private-key>")
        .servicePeerId(servicePeerId)
        .serviceUrl("https://ionstore.example.com:8443")
        .build();
```

**Device mode** — when the full user key should not live on the device:

```java
IonStore store = IonStore.builder()
        .userId(Id.of("<Base58-user-public-key>"))
        .deviceKey("<Base58-device-private-key>")
        .servicePeerId(servicePeerId)
        .serviceUrl("https://ionstore.example.com:8443")
        .build();
```

Provide an external `Vertx` with `.vertx(vertx)`; if omitted, the current Vert.x context's instance is used, so building outside a Vert.x context requires `.vertx(...)`. When done:

```java
store.close().get();
```

### Put (store an object)

`put()` opens a fluent `PutRequest`: describe the object (name, content type, TTL in seconds, custom `Ion-*` metadata, optional encryption), name exactly one payload source with `content(...)`, then call `send()`. It completes with the stored object's metadata as an `IonObject`. Setters are order-independent; a later `content(...)` replaces an earlier one.

```java
// From a byte array
IonObject obj = store.put()
        .name("hello.txt")
        .contentType("text/plain")
        .ttl(3600)                       // seconds; capped by the service maximum, 0 = service default
        .metadata("Ion-Tag", "greeting") // custom Ion-* metadata (the Ion- prefix is added if missing)
        .content("hello".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
        .send()
        .get();
System.out.println(obj.getId());        // reference id, for ions:// addressing
System.out.println(obj.getContentId()); // SHA-256 content id
System.out.println(obj.getUri());       // ions://<peerId>/<id>

// From a file (name/content type default to the file's own)
IonObject fromFile = store.put().content(Path.of("/data/photo.jpg")).send().get();

// From a Buffer, a blocking InputStream, or any Vert.x ReadStream<Buffer>
store.put().content(Buffer.buffer(bytes)).send();
store.put().content(inputStream).contentLength(len /* omit if unknown */).send();
```

> **Payload ownership.** A put is asynchronous and the payload is generally **not** copied — it is read as the upload streams — so leave the source alone until the returned future completes: do not modify the array/buffer, do not touch the file, and do not read from the stream. By default the client does **not** close a supplied `InputStream`; pass `content(stream, true)` to hand ownership over. A `ReadStream` is consumed but not closed. The `contentLength(...)` hint applies only to the stream sources (the array, buffer, and file sources measure themselves).

### Get (retrieve an object)

Retrieval is permissionless. `get(id)` opens a fluent `GetRequest`. Unlike `put()`, a get has no separate terminal call — naming the destination **is** the terminal operation, because once the destination is known there is nothing left to configure. Every result is an `Optional`, empty when the object does not exist.

The `toBytes()` destination loads the integrity-verified payload into memory and returns a `BytesIonObject` (an `IonObject` that also carries its payload):

```java
Optional<BytesIonObject> result = store.get(id).toBytes().get();
result.ifPresent(obj -> {
    byte[] bytes = obj.getBytes();       // or obj.getContent() for a Buffer
    System.out.println(obj.getContentId() + " / " + obj.getSize());
});
```

For large objects, stream straight to a destination instead of buffering — a file, a blocking `OutputStream`, a Vert.x `WriteStream<Buffer>`, or a caller-supplied `Buffer` to append to. These complete with the object's `IonObject` metadata (empty if not found):

```java
// To a file - the partial file is removed on any failure (including an integrity mismatch)
store.get(id).toFile(Path.of("/tmp/out.bin")).get();

// To a blocking OutputStream; by default the client does NOT close it.
// Pass toOutputStream(stream, true) to have the client close it when the transfer ends.
store.get(id).toOutputStream(outputStream).get();

// Append to a caller-owned Buffer (only metadata is returned; the payload is in your buffer)
Buffer sink = Buffer.buffer();
store.get(id).toBuffer(sink).get();
```

### Encryption

The payload can be encrypted client-side so the service only ever sees ciphertext. Supply a `SecretStream.KEY_BYTES`-byte key to `put().encrypt(key)`; the key never leaves the client. The stored object is flagged `Ion-Encrypted` and carries an `Ion-Encryption` descriptor (scheme + chunk size), so it stays decryptable even if the client's defaults change later.

```java
byte[] key = Random.randomBytes(SecretStream.KEY_BYTES);   // keep this; the service cannot recover it

IonObject stored = store.put().content(plaintext).encrypt(key).send().get();
stored.isEncrypted();         // true
stored.getSize();             // the stored (ciphertext) length
stored.getPlainTextSize();    // the original plaintext length
```

To read it back, hand the same key to `get(id).decrypt(key)` — the payload is decrypted as it streams, so the destination receives plaintext:

```java
byte[] plaintext = store.get(id).decrypt(key).toBytes().get().orElseThrow().getBytes();
```

The request and the object must agree: fetching an encrypted object without `decrypt(key)`, or supplying a key for an object that is not encrypted, fails with `DecryptionException` rather than returning bytes that are not what you asked for. To handle an encrypted object **without** the key — caching, relaying, or copying it to another store — use `raw()`, which yields the stored ciphertext (still integrity-checked) verbatim:

```java
store.get(id).raw().toFile(Path.of("/tmp/blob.enc")).get();
```

> **Encryption defeats deduplication by design.** Each encrypted stream begins with a fresh random header, so identical plaintext produces different ciphertext — and therefore a different content id — on every put. A re-uploaded object is a new object, not a dedup hit, which counts against quota.

### Metadata, listing, existence, deletion

```java
// Metadata only, without downloading the payload
Optional<IonObject> meta = store.getIonObject(id).get();   // empty if not found

// Existence check (HEAD)
boolean present = store.exists(id).get();

// Paginated listing of the authenticated user's objects (1-based page)
PaginatedResult<IonObject> page = store.list(1, 100).get();
for (IonObject o : page.items())
    System.out.println(o.getId());

// Delete a reference owned by the authenticated user
boolean deleted = store.delete(id).get();        // false if it did not exist
```

### Federation

To fetch an object that lives on a different Ion Store node, open the get with `get(peerId, id)`; the bound service fetches and caches it for you. The returned `GetRequest` behaves exactly like the local one — same destinations, same `decrypt(key)`/`raw()`:

```java
Optional<BytesIonObject> obj = store.get(peerId, id).toBytes().get();
store.get(peerId, id).toFile(Path.of("/tmp/out.bin")).get();
```

## API Overview

**Entry points** (`put()` opens a `PutRequest`, `get(...)` a `GetRequest`; both are terminated as shown):

| Method | Returns | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `put()` | `PutRequest` | yes | Fluent builder; terminated by `send()`. |
| `get(Id)` / `get(Id peerId, Id)` | `GetRequest` | no | Fluent builder; terminated by a `to*(...)` destination. |
| `getIonObject(Id)` | `Optional<IonObject>` | no | Metadata only (no payload); empty if absent. |
| `exists(Id)` | `Boolean` | no | HEAD check. |
| `list(long page, long pageSize)` | `PaginatedResult<IonObject>` | yes | The caller's objects, newest first. |
| `delete(Id)` | `Boolean` | yes | `false` if the object did not exist. |
| `close()` | `Void` | — | Releases the HTTP client. |

**`PutRequest`** — configure, then `send()`:

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `content(byte[] / Buffer / Path / InputStream[, closeStream] / ReadStream)` | The payload source (required; a later call replaces an earlier one). |
| `name(String)`, `contentType(String)`, `ttl(long seconds)` | Object description; all optional. |
| `contentLength(long)` | Length hint for the stream sources; ignored by array/buffer/file. |
| `metadata(String, Object)` / `metadata(Map)` | Custom `Ion-*` metadata. |
| `encrypt(byte[] key)` | Client-side encryption with a `SecretStream.KEY_BYTES`-byte key. |
| `send()` → `CompletableFuture<IonObject>` | Uploads and completes with the stored metadata. |

**`GetRequest`** — optionally shape, then choose a destination (the destination is the terminal call):

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `decrypt(byte[] key)` | Decrypt as it streams; mutually exclusive with `raw()`. |
| `raw()` | Take the stored bytes verbatim (ciphertext for encrypted objects), still integrity-checked. |
| `toBytes()` → `Optional<BytesIonObject>` | Into memory, payload included. |
| `toBuffer(Buffer)` → `Optional<IonObject>` | Append payload to a caller buffer; returns metadata only. |
| `toFile(Path)` → `Optional<IonObject>` | To a file; removed on failure. |
| `toOutputStream(OutputStream[, boolean close])` → `Optional<IonObject>` | To a blocking stream; not closed unless requested. |
| `toWriteStream(WriteStream<Buffer>)` → `Optional<IonObject>` | To a Vert.x write stream (ended on completion). |

Accessors: `getUserId()`, `getDeviceId()`, `getServicePeerId()`, `getServiceUrl()`, `isClosed()`.

## Integrity

Every payload retrieval is verified: the client hashes the streamed bytes (SHA-256) and compares the result against the content id the service advertises in the `Ion-Content-Id` header. A mismatch — or a missing/malformed header — fails the future with `ObjectIntegrityException`.

- For the **file** sink, the partially written file is removed on failure.
- For an **`OutputStream`/`WriteStream`** sink, the destination cannot be rolled back: corrupt bytes may already have been written before the future fails.
- Because the content id covers the whole object, **ranged downloads are intentionally not offered** — a partial body cannot be verified.

## Error Handling

Failures surface as [`IonStoreException`](src/main/java/io/bosonnetwork/ionstore/exceptions/IonStoreException.java) or one of its category-specific subclasses in the [`exceptions`](src/main/java/io/bosonnetwork/ionstore/exceptions) package, so you can react by catching the specific type:

| Exception | When |
|---|---|
| `UnauthorizedException` | Missing/invalid token (HTTP 401) — fix credentials |
| `ForbiddenException` | Not permitted (HTTP 403) |
| `TtlExceededException` | Requested TTL above the service maximum (HTTP 403) — lower the TTL |
| `InvalidRequestException` | Malformed request / bad id / bad pagination (HTTP 400) |
| `ObjectTooLargeException` | Payload above the service maximum (HTTP 413) — reduce size |
| `QuotaExceededException` | Storage quota exhausted (HTTP 507) — free space or retry later |
| `ObjectNotFoundException` | Object absent (HTTP 404) — *not* thrown by `get`/`exists`/`delete`, which return `null`/`false` |
| `ObjectIntegrityException` | Content-id mismatch on download (or a service-side integrity error, HTTP 422) |
| `DecryptionException` | Client-side only: the get and the object disagree about encryption (encrypted object fetched without a key, or a key supplied for a plain object), or the ciphertext cannot be framed for decryption. Carries no HTTP status. |
| `IonStoreIOException`, `MetabaseException`, `IonStoreServerException` | Server-side faults (HTTP 500) |
| `PeerNotFoundException`, `PeerRequestException`, `PeerResponseException` | Federation faults (HTTP 502) |

Every exception preserves the response's details: `getStatus()` (the HTTP status, or `IonStoreException.NO_HTTP_STATUS` for transport/client-side errors), `getErrorCode()` (the service's stable numeric code, preserved even for an unrecognized category), `getMessage()` (the service message, with any federation peer detail appended), and `getNested()` (the remote peer's status/message for federation failures).

Catch the **specific type** rather than branching on the HTTP status: a single status can map to more than one category — HTTP `403` is returned both for `ForbiddenException` and for `TtlExceededException`. An error category the client does not recognize (e.g. from a newer service) surfaces as a plain `IonStoreException` that still carries the original numeric code.

```java
try {
    store.put().content(bytes).send().get();
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    if (e.getCause() instanceof QuotaExceededException qe)
        // free space or retry later
    else if (e.getCause() instanceof ObjectTooLargeException te)
        // reduce the payload size
    else if (e.getCause() instanceof TtlExceededException tt)
        // lower the requested TTL
    else if (e.getCause() instanceof UnauthorizedException ue)
        // fix credentials / token
    else if (e.getCause() instanceof IonStoreException ise)
        // ise.getStatus() / ise.getErrorCode() / ise.getMessage()
}
```
